# Zooquarium

## Description

The web application we envision is a user-friendly platform that allows animal enthusiasts to easily search for specific animals and find nearby zoos that have them. Our application has a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to enter a search query for an animal they are interested in.

Once the user has entered their search query, the application would return an image and list of results, with each result containing information about the animal. Each search input that is entered by the user will be stored; this will allow users to easily switch between previously searched information with ease.

The application also uses geolocation technology to determine the user's location, making it easy to find nearby zoos. Each zoo that is provided are part of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums; an organization that ensures the welfare of every animal. Users also have the option to enter their location manually, or search for zoos in a specific region or city. Users can view a popup above the zoo of choice, providing a hyperlink to that specific zoo. This allows users to easily access detailed information about the zoo, including its location, hours of operation, admission fees, and a map showing the exact location of the zoo.

To make it even more convenient, the application would offer a feature that would allow users to map directions to the selected zoo directly from the site, eliminating the need to switch between the application and a separate map application. The directions will be provided, and users could choose their preferred mode of transportation, such as driving, walking, or public transit.

Overall, the web application is a comprehensive and user-friendly platform that would make it easy for animal enthusiasts to find and visit their favorite animals at nearby accredited zoos.

## Credits

There were many moving parts in this project. Our team worked together diligently to ensure that we had a working application that was user-friendly and fun to create.

In order to meet our project goals, we worked together to work through our obstacles. We also employed the assistance of out instructor and TAs in the bootcamp. A majority of help came from viewing and reading through online materials from MDN, W3Schools, Stackoverflow, and API documentation.
